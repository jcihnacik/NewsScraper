  Whenever a user visits the site, the app scrapes stories from Reuters and displays them for the user. Each scraped article saves to the application database. The app scrapes and displays the following information for each article:

     * Headline - the title of the article

     * Summary - a short summary of the article

     * URL - the url to the original article


  Users can also leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments save to the database as well and are associated with their articles. Users can also delete comments left on articles. All stored comments should be visible to every user.
